Java Examples for Geoscientists
Dr. Lofi Dewanto

# Introduction
This course introduces participants to the fundamental concepts of Java programming and their application in geoscience. It covers the basics of Java programming, focusing on writing simple Java programs to analyze geoscience data. Participants will learn how to effectively use control structures, basic input/output operations, and core programming concepts to perform scientific computations. The course will also introduce key Java programming paradigms, including object-oriented, descriptive and functional programming. Testing, now an essential practice, is also highlighted. Additionally, participants will learn about the existence of various libraries for working with geoscience data in Java, expanding their toolkit for handling spatial and environmental datasets. By the end of the course, participants will have a foundation in Java programming with practical applications in geoscience research and analysis.
